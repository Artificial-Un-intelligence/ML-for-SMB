# 🚀 How Small Businesses Can Use AI to Improve Daily Operations (with C# Examples)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn’t just for big tech companies. With today’s tools, **small businesses can use AI to make smarter decisions, reduce waste, and boost efficiency** — all using code you can write in C#.

Here are **four practical ways** you can apply AI to everyday operations, with sample code you can adapt to your own business systems.

## 1️⃣ Forecasting Demand

Knowing what’s coming next week helps avoid stockouts, cut down on waste, and improve customer satisfaction.

Using ML.NET’s **SSA forecaster**, you can predict sales or traffic based on historical data:

```csharp
var pipeline = ml.Forecasting.ForecastBySsa(
    outputColumnName: nameof(ForecastPoint.ForecastedValues),
    inputColumnName: nameof(SaleRow.Units),
    windowSize: 7, seriesLength: 60, trainSize: 90, horizon: 14);

var model = pipeline.Fit(dv);
var forecast = model.CreateTimeSeriesEngine<SaleRow, ForecastPoint>(ml).Predict();
```

💡 **Impact:** Run this nightly per SKU or location to know what to expect and plan ahead.

## 2️⃣ Smarter Reordering

Forecasting is only useful if it drives action. With a few lines of C#, you can calculate **when to reorder** and **how much to purchase**:

```csharp
var (reorderPoint, orderQty) = InventoryMath.ReorderPlan(
    avgDailyDemand: 50, dailyDemandStdDev: 10,
    leadTimeDays: 7, reviewPeriodDays: 7,
    onHand: 200, onOrder: 100,
    targetDaysOfSupply: 14);
```

💡 **Impact:** Be proactive instead of reactive — fewer emergencies, smoother supply chain.

---

## 3️⃣ Smarter Staffing

Overstaffing is expensive. Understaffing costs customers. By connecting demand forecasts to staffing plans, you can schedule **the right number of people at the right time**:

```csharp
static int StaffNeeded(float expected, float capacityPerStaff)
    => (int)Math.Ceiling(expected / capacityPerStaff);

Console.WriteLine(StaffNeeded(120, 40)); // → 3 staff needed
```

💡 **Impact:** Align shifts with actual demand, not guesswork.

## 4️⃣ Spotting Anomalies

AI can catch unusual patterns in transactions — refund abuse, suspicious sales spikes, or sudden drops — before they become costly.

Using ML.NET’s SR-CNN anomaly detector:

```csharp
var pipeline = ml.Transforms.DetectAnomalyBySrCnn(
    outputColumnName: "Predictions",
    inputColumnName: nameof(TxnRow.Amount),
    threshold: 0.35, batchSize: 64, sensitivity: 95);

var model = pipeline.Fit(data);
var results = model.Transform(data);
```

💡 **Impact:** Get alerted automatically when something looks “off” in your daily numbers.

## ✅ Wrapping Up

Small businesses don’t need massive budgets or teams of data scientists to benefit from AI. With **ML.NET and C#**, you can:
- Forecast demand
- Automate reordering
- Optimize staffing
- Detect anomalies

These improvements compound over time — saving money, improving service, and giving your business a competitive edge.
